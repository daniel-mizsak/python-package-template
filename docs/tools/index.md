# Tools

Python is really powerful for creating proof of concept solutions and running scripts, but there are many tools that can help elevate our projects to the next level by making them **more maintainable and higher quality**.

Below is a list of the tools that I use for almost every project. Navigate to the dedicated documentation page to learn more about each tool.

- [Just](./just.md) - Command runner.
- [Uv](./uv.md) - Package manager, similar to `pip`.
- [Ruff](./ruff.md) - Code formatter and linter.
- [MyPy](./mypy.md) - Static type checker.
- [Pytest](./pytest.md) - Modern testing framework.
- [Nox](./nox.md) - Testing automation framework for multiple Python environments.
- [Megalinter](./megalinter.md) - Many-in-one linter solution.
- [Pre-Commit](./pre-commit.md) - Git pre-commit hook manager.
- [Codecov](./codecov.md) - Platform for tracking code coverage.
- [Zensical](./zensical.md) - Static site generator for documentation.
